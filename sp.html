								<p>For my senior project, I focused on the construction and security implementation on the computers in Ascend Leadership Academy’s computer lab. I built and configured all Windows PCs in the lab.
                                    A major aspect of my project involved the security of the systems. I learned how to implement firewalls, antivirus software, and configured user access to protect administrator access, but maintain the functionality of the computer. This made sure that the systems were protected from possible threats, making them safe for students and staff to use.
                                     </p>
								
								<p>After setting up all the security systems in the computer lab, I realized there was still one big problem, many of these security solutions only detect threats after they’ve already caused damage. With over 3.4 billion phishing emails and text messages being sent daily, I noticedthat none of the security measures I had put in place were checking these types of messages initially.
                                    This is why I came up with the idea for Inbox Defender. A simple security tool that helps users analyze suspicious emails and messages before they download any harmful attachments. I designed it specifically for the older age groups, who are often targeted by phishing scams. Many of them struggle with noticing these scams, so my goal with this app is to give them an easy way to avoid falling victim to phishing scams. Inbox Defender fixes this problem by catching these threats before they even have a chance to cause harm.
